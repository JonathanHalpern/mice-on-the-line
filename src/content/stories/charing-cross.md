Some creatures are rare in London. You are unlikely to find giraffes or snakes, zebras or poisonous frogs walking the streets of England's capital unless you take a trip to London Zoo.

<!--break-->

However, two creatures you are extremely likely to find here are pigeons and mice. With so many around, it is small wonder that these rather different creatures have come to learn each other's languages. This skill proves particularly useful is when one or the other is lost and needs some directions from its land-dwelling or sky-flying companion.

This just so happened to be the case one afternoon at Trafalgar Square, when a pigeon followed a lady into the London Underground. The lady in question wore a grumpy expression on her long, grey face. Her clothing was speckled with flecks of white.

<!--break-->

Moments before, she had been standing in the hustle and bustle of Trafalgar Square when she had rushed over to a child feeding the pigeons underneath Nelson's Column and confiscated his bag of bread.

<!--break-->

“There's enough of these disease-riddled scumbags in London already without you feeding them, thoughtless child!” The little boy had begun to cry, for he had carried the crumbs with him all morning just to feed the birds. Outraged, the child's parents had rushed over to the woman, demanding she give the bread back. However, the lady held on to the bag so tightly that, when the boy's father reached over to grab it, the plastic ripped and both boy and lady were covered head to toe in crumbs.

At this, the boy delighted. Pigeons from all around were coming to peck bread from his laces to his hair.

<!--break-->![null](img/charing-cross-cover.jpeg)

For the same reason, the lady was horrified. She scampered to the nearest tube station to avoid the onslaught of pigeons, feeling herself pinched and pecked by the nasty beasts.<!--break-->

When she had descended into the depths of the Underground, only one pigeon was left on her trail. His name was Victor.

Whereas the lady might describe him as a filthy bird, grey and uninteresting with beady eyes and a cruel beak, the little boy would have paid attention to the marvellous green and purple sheen on his neck, or the fact that his feet were perfectly formed and still pink, despite walking around London's grubby streets. If he'd looked hard enough, the boy may even have noticed a softness in the pigeon's amber eyes.

<!--break-->After all, Victor was a young pigeon and, although that meant he often lost his way, it also meant that he had not been hardened by some of the cruelty many city-dwelling pigeons face every day. Unfortunately for Victor, that was about to change.

![null](img/charing-cross-cover.jpeg)<!--break-->

Despite the fact that Victor was only picking at the trail of crumbs left by this volatile woman (he had not pecked a single piece directly off her body), she waited at the bottom of the escalator to hit him with her hard handbag. Usually, it is quite difficult to hit a pigeon, but as Victor was so intent on picking up crumbs, he was oblivious to the attack. Her bag caught his left wing and forced it to jam under the end of the track, leaving him utterly helpless! One kind commuter pushed the 'Emergency Stop' button on the escalator. Victor did not know if this was for his sake or because a flapping pigeon at the end of an escalator is a safety hazard for humans (never mind the pigeon).

<!--break-->By this point, the lady had vanished, no doubt to head home and have a shower after she had been in contact with so many “flying rats”.

![null](img/charing-cross-cover.jpeg)<!--break-->Although Victor was a young bird, he was wise enough to understand that what he had experienced was an act of violence not just on him but on all pigeon-kind. It felt utterly unfair to be in so much pain when he had done very little wrong, and as his inner-eyelids washed over his eyes (as a pigeon's do), he felt them moisten with tears.

Victor was not one to feel sorry for himself but, as well as the fact that he was stuck underground with a sore wing, he also realised he was lost. Now he could not fly, he had no idea how to return to the surface. And that's when he spotted Nellie.

<span class="justify-line">Nellie is a true mouse of the underground. Her eyesight is poor from spending so</span><!--break-->much of her life in tunnels or under train tracks, and she has never ventured outside. This might sound surprising, but the life of a mouse is quite dangerous with so many people stomping around, so many mice decide to stick to the routes they know. Nellie is just such a mouse.

![null](img/charing-cross-cover.jpeg)<!--break-->

However, she is also a kind mouse, and upon hearing the sad coo of a pigeon, she scuttled over to see if she could help. When she was close enough, she could see that Victor had hurt his wing. She could also see that he seemed disorientated by the vast crowds walking past him. She scurried to the bird's side and squeaked, “Follow me.” The pigeon, who by this point was totally clueless, did not need telling twice.

Nellie led Victor to an alcove away from passers-by and asked him what had happened to his wing. Victor explained how the lady he followed onto the underground attacked him.

<!--break-->

“Why, that's horrible!” Nellie sympathised. “Though, you must know by now that humans are a cruel race.” Here, Victor seemed surprised, for although he had recently experienced human cruelty first-hand, he also remembered the times people – usually children – took time to feed him and his friends. He told Nellie about the little boy, who had taken such joy in sharing his crumbs.

Nellie was unconvinced: “Well, I am yet to meet a kind human, and living on the underground I have met a lot. Most just ignore me and I have to dart out of their paths in case they tread on me, but others try to chase me and some even lay down traps!”

<!--break-->

Victor could understand the mouse's distrust of humans, but he seemed determined to prove her wrong. He thought that perhaps it was easier to witness acts of kindness when one is flying above people than when one is under their feet. This thought gave Victor an idea. “I know! Once I'm better and I'm able to fly again, why don't I take you on a ride outside?” At this, Nellie was shaken, as the thought of going outside was terrifying enough, without being high in the sky! However, Nellie promised she would consider the pigeon's offer.

<!--break-->

![null](img/charing-cross-cover.jpeg)

Over the next week, Victor's wing began to heal. Nellie took care of her new companion by bringing him crumbs she found on the track.

<!--break-->

Meanwhile, the two struck up an unlikely friendship. When it came to the point where Victor was ready to fly up the escalator and back to the surface, Nellie felt happy that her new friend felt better, but sad that they might never see each other again. After all, what use does a pigeon have for the underground when he can fly across the city? On the other hand, she thought to herself, I am an old mouse and this might be my last chance to see the outside world. With this thought spurring her on, Nellie told Victor that she would take him up on his offer to see the world. Both creatures went to sleep that night dreaming of their big day ahead.

<!--break-->

Unlike people, mice and pigeons do not need to do all that much to get ready in the morning. They do not get dressed or brush their teeth and they have no blankets to curl back up in on a cold day. Therefore, as soon as Victor and Nellie were awake (and after a little cleaning of the feathers and behind the ears), they were ready to face the day.

At first, Nellie perched awkwardly on Victor, scared to hurt her friend's newly recovered wing, but Victor ruffled his feathers around the little mouse, creating a comfy seat.

<!--break-->

![null](img/charing-cross-cover.jpeg)

He reassured her that his wing was good as new and, when the mouse was ready (or as ready as she would ever be), the two friends took flight!

At first, Nellie's fear was far greater than anything she had experienced before. From all her years on the underground, avoiding people's footsteps, mousetraps and even the monstrous trains themselves, nothing could have prepared her for the sensation of flying six feet up in the air, with billboards and lights whooshing past at speeds unable to be reached by the small feet of a mouse. She had known this world all her life from the ground up and here she was, seeing it all rush beneath her. It was quite dizzying.

<!--break-->

However, she soon began to get used to the sensation and this is when she started noticing people's faces. From the ground and with her poor eyesight, she had only ever been aware of the differences between people's shoes: she must avoid the heavy working boots because getting stomped by one of those would mean certain death; stilettos are particularly dangerous for chopping off a mouse's tail; small toddlers' feet might not be lethal, but a mouse can never be sure if they will move in a logical pattern.

<!--break-->

However, from up here Nellie saw that, just like mice, many people had different hair colours. She saw that some looked grumpy, as she had expected, but others wore huge smiles on their faces. She wondered if they were happy because they had trodden on a mouse.
Nellie had been paying so much attention to the people that she almost forgot her reason for taking flight in the first place. It was only when a great light appeared before her that she remembered: I'm going to see the outside world!

Victor asked if she was alright, and Nellie squeaked that she was fine, though her eyes did not feel they could stay open in the face of this brilliant white.

<!--break-->

![null](img/charing-cross-cover.jpeg)

She closed her eyes for the final few moments on the underground and felt, rather than saw, fresh air flatten the fur on her cheek and back. Her tail felt the wind, and it felt good. Slowly, very slowly because her eyes were not accustomed to the brightness, Nellie opened her eyelids. And what a sight to behold!

<!--break-->

Flickering orange lights had been replaced by warm sunshine, trains gave way to cars and bikes of all different colours and sizes, the billboards she had seen plastered on walls were now everywhere, from lamp-posts to great double-decker buses. What struck Nellie most was the fact that there was no ceiling above her, just endless blue sky (for Victor brought Nellie out to see London on a beautiful summer's day. Perhaps her opinion would be quite different if it had been drizzling and grey!)

And there in front of her, cutting through that great blue sky, was the single tallest thing Nellie had ever seen.

<!--break-->

![null](img/charing-cross-cover.jpeg)

I suppose that might not be saying much for a mouse who has spent her life living in the confines of the London Underground, so let's try that again: This was the single tallest thing Nellie could ever have imagined. She squeaked in delight, “Victor, Victor! What is that magnificent building?”

<!--break-->

Victor, who had been keeping an eye out for his flock, did not know what Nellie meant. After all, he was used to Trafalgar Square and didn't see it with the same sense of wonderment as Nellie. He asked her what building she meant: “Right in front of us! Tall, thin, magnificent!” Here, Nellie took a gasp, for she had noticed something else about the building, “And... there's a human stuck at the top of it!” Victor laughed – a sound between a gurgle and a coo - “Why, that's Nelson's Column! Here, I'll show you.” And, with that, Victor soared upwards.

Nellie was too shocked to refuse, but as the ground grew further and further away the little mouse realised she did not feel fear, but excitement.

<!--break-->

![null](img/charing-cross-cover.jpeg)

Within seconds they were perched on the shoulder of Horatio Nelson: one of the greatest naval officers in the history of Britain and the world! Victor told her all about his great conquest of the seas and Nellie marvelled at her friend's knowledge.

<!--break-->

Victor promised to show her the plaques at the bottom of the column, which offered great depictions of the Battle of Trafalgar. Nellie felt mightily proud to share a similar name to such an esteemed person. “See,” Victor boasted, “Some humans are good after all.” Nellie pondered this a moment. It was clear Nelson was a great officer, but she doubted he would act kindly towards a mouse aboard his ship.

It was while she sat thinking of how tremendous it would be to lead a boat into battle, that a pigeon flew by and landed a large white smattering of poop on Nelson's shoulder, a mere inch away from Nellie! The mouse squeaked in outrage: “How dare you!” Victor, seeing the disgust on his friend's face, merely laughed once more. “Don't look so shocked, Nellie, this is where all us pigeons leave our droppings!”

<!--break-->

Nellie was too dumbfounded to speak, thinking her pigeon compatriot too polite for such vile behaviour, so Victor continued: “It's rather better for the humans if we do our business all the way up here where no one can see, rather than down there where they could slip up and hurt themselves.” Nellie could not fault her friend's logic, but thought it rather disrespectful to poop on such a great historical figure all the same.

<!--break-->

All this time, Victor had been keeping an eye out for his friends and family, whom he was certain would be worried about his disappearance. Suddenly, he recognised a passing pigeon and tracked where she was heading. Down his pigeon-friend spiralled until she landed at the foot of the statue, where Victor saw a great flock of fellow pigeons. Excitedly, he asked Nellie to hop upon his back and the pair of them flew towards his friends. Just before landing, Victor recognised two faces in the crowds. He could not believe his eyes!

<!--break-->

![null](img/charing-cross-cover.jpeg)

Before him was not only the little boy who had offered his crumbs the previous week, but also the horrible woman who had attacked Victor! She was crouched behind the column's great steps, seething with hatred as she saw the dear little boy throw crumbs to his favourite birds.

<!--break-->

Nellie felt the bird's feathers ruffle uneasily and asked him what was wrong. Victor pointed out the two figures with his beak and told the mouse what he had seen. Was he to return to his flock only to see the same frightful woman attack him once more? Then, something remarkable happened.

Nellie, who up until this day had been a shy, unassuming mouse, who had avoided contact with human beings at all costs, and who thought she would spend the remainder of her days living in solitude on the London Underground, came up with a masterful plan.

<!--break-->

Spurred on by the naval tactics of her namesake – Nelson – and inspired by the questionable toiletry habits of her feathery friends, she whispered her plan to Victor. His eyes grew wide in disbelief, but just as Nellie thought he would tell her the plan was ridiculous, he squarked: “wonderful,” and, with tears of laughter in his eyes, they flew off to rally the troops.

Victor's friends were delighted to see him and began cooing and ruffling their feathers as a show of affection. However, Nellie – still atop the pigeon – squeaked that there was no time to waste and, with all the charisma of a true leader, told Victor's friends of her marvellous plan.

<!--break-->

![null](img/charing-cross-cover.jpeg)

The pigeons looked around and, sure enough, they could see the hateful woman inching closer to their flock with a manic look in her eyes. They agreed that Nellie's plan should be put into place immediately in case of an imminent attack and all of the birds took flight.

<!--break-->

It was a magnificent sight to behold – tens, if not hundreds of pigeons simultaneously rising upwards – and the little boy looked in wonder at their perfect formation. The woman, on the other hand, seemed outraged that the birds had moved skywards, for she had been planning to sprinkle poisonous pellets amongst the crumbs!

Indeed, the vindictive woman had been planning her return to Trafalgar Square all week. She had felt disgusted by the birds, angered by the boy's parents and mortified by the boy himself, whose upbeat reaction to being covered in pigeons left her feeling quite sick.

<!--break-->

The fact that she – a good citizen only trying to rid the world of these disease-carrying, ugly feather-brains – she had been the one made to flee the scene when things turned nasty, forced a great ball of fury to lodge itself in her throat. She decided that the only way to regain her dignity was to come back and murder them all!

Well, that was the initial plan, at least. After a while she decided she would spare the boy and his parents... but by the size of the bag by her side, filled with green tablets, we can safely suppose that she wanted every pigeon in Victor's flock well and truly dead. Now, thanks to Nellie, she was not going to get that chance.

<!--break-->

For above her now, circling and swooping, was a flying mass of grey, purple and green. She could not possibly see Nellie riding Victor, but if she could she would wonder if anything could be more foul than a mouse atop a pigeon. The little boy, who - through adoration of the pigeons - was much more observant, was certain he had seen a tiny passenger nestled in Victor's feathers, and as he cheered the pigeons in their glorious dance, he imagined the mouse as a great leader.

He could not possibly have known how right he was, for in that moment Nellie truly imagined herself as Horatio Nelson steering his HMS Victory into battle.

<!--break-->

![null](img/charing-cross-cover.jpeg)

The birds – her ships and cannons – were primed for attack, and with a rallying squeak of: “Dis...CHARGE!” the birds swooped over the woman and released their pigeon droppings so that not a patch of her was left without smatterings of white-green slime.

<!--break-->

Victor looked back as he wished to see the lady's expression, but it was impossible to read under all the gloop.

Nellie did manage a fleeting glance backwards. Through her poor eyesight, she thought she saw the little boy walk towards the lady and offer her something: a tissue, perhaps, to wipe her face. In that moment, she remembered what Victor had said about some people not being all that bad. Flying through the air, she considered the people she had met today and thought that, actually, they weren't too different from mice after all: some heroic, some villainous, some kind, and probably lots in between. The only real difference, is that they are an awful lot bigger.

<!--break-->

Feeling tired from the day's adventures, and aware that Victor had a lot of catching up to do with his flock, she asked her companion to take her home. By now, Victor had grown accustomed to the underground and found that flying her back was much safer than taking the escalator. When they reached the bottom, the two friends cooed and squeaked their gratitude towards one another. Victor promised to take Nellie on trips out into the world so she could see more sights of London, and he remained true to his promise.

<!--break-->

![null](img/charing-cross-cover.jpeg)

Regular daylight seemed to do wonders for Nellie's eyesight, and flying atop Trafalgar Square did wonders for her soul. Out on their adventures, they spied many different humans, good and bad, happy and sad... but they never saw the lady at Trafalgar Square again.
