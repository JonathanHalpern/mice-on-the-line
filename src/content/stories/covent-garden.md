When Harry was a young mouse, he had been travelling on the Piccadilly Line with his family when he saw something extraordinary. It was a man covered entirely in gold. 

A mouse does not usually pay much attention to a human's choice of clothing. Beyond shoes (which prove dangerous for mice) a person's trousers, shirt or hat have very little to do with a mouse's life. Besides, a human is so large that it is difficult for a mouse to see much higher than their knees. However, a man covered in gold is impossible to miss.
