You may think it gets rather cold in England at winter. Everyone heads outside in their cozy coats and woollen scarves, wrapped up tightly against the chill. Fingers are covered and socks are extra cozy. Even then, you will hear people complain, “Isn't it cold this year!”

“Oh yes,” the response might come, “and I'm even wearing thermal undercrackers!”

Well, just imagine how chilly it must be for a small creature whose sole warmth comes from a thin layer of fur, whose feet pitter-patter on the frozen ground (unless they are lucky enough to have made a pair of thin boots from leather scraps), and who have never so much as heard of thermal knickers!
