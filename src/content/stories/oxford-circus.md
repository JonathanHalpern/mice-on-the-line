You may think it gets rather cold in England at winter. Everyone heads outside in their cozy coats and woollen scarves, wrapped up tightly against the chill. Fingers are covered and socks are extra cozy. Even then, you will hear people complain, “Isn't it cold this year!”
“Oh yes,” the response might come, “and I'm even wearing thermal undercrackers!”
Well, just imagine how chilly it must be for a small creature whose sole warmth comes from a thin layer of fur, whose feet pitter-patter on the frozen ground (unless they are lucky enough to have made a pair of thin boots from leather scraps), and who have never so much as heard of thermal knickers! Indeed, mice do get very chilly at wintertime and many of the critters who usually find themselves out on London's streets delve into the Underground network for shelter from the blustery wind, rain and occasional snow.
However, there is one day during winter that mice will poke their heads out of their holes and – if they feel daring enough – come to the surface. This is the day when the Christmas lights go on in Oxford Street. Now, if you've seen this particular light display, you'll know that it is brilliant to behold: sometimes the lights are shaped like angels, other years as huge baubles, once or twice modelled on great reindeer pulling sleighs. However, for all these different designs, one thing remains the same every year: they are magnificent. Just imagine, then, how spectacular this sight would be to a creature a hundred times smaller than you! For a mouse, the bright shape of a star covered in filaments of light would appear not as a pretty decoration, but as though the starry night sky had showered its treasures down to Earth. If such a sight is not worth feeling cold for, a mouse will tell you, nothing is.
You can only imagine the amount of work that goes into such a display as the Oxford Street lights. Each year, someone has to design the lights, another team must create them and then many strong and agile workers must fix them in place above our heads. And that's not to mention the electricity! For such a stellar display, there needs to be a great source of power to ensure it stays lit during England's darkest months. Huge electrical boxes are stationed around this bustling street for any light that needs to be connected by thick, durable wires. These are checked and double-checked by London's finest electricians, but just to be on the safe side (and because they like to feel involved) these boxes are often checked a third time by mice, who climb into the slats just to check no fellow rodent has made her nest in the boxes, away from the winter's cold outdoors.
One chilly November morning before the lights were due to be turned on, Ellie the mouse decided to check on the electrical boxes. Ellie was a whiz with electricity. Having lived on the London Underground all her life, she had been made particularly aware of the dangers posed by currents and shocks. She often taught baby mice how to manage the train-lines without getting zapped: “you may scamper under the line,” she would say, “and you may even scamper across the line. But you must never touch the ground and the line at the same time.” Ellie had seen a large rat put a paw up on the line one fateful day, and the shock that rodent received was enough to teach her first-hand the immense power of electricity. She also knew that it was dangerous for mice to chew on the protective casing around wires: “If these wires were to touch one another because you've been silly enough to chew on them, you might get frazzled!” Since Ellie began her classes in the dangers of electricity, there have been far fewer rodents injured on the Underground. Therefore, the great honour of checking on the Christmas display boxes was given to her.
Up she popped from her home in Oxford Street tube station, and immediately she felt the harsh chill on her whiskers. Nonetheless, the excitement of the Christmas lights drove her onwards. They were to be turned on the following evening and there were five boxes to check, so there was little time to spare! The first box was close enough. Ellie looked upwards to see if she could make out what shape the lights would make when switched on. As is often the case, many of the displays are moving images, which means that different lights need to be turned on and off to be able to see the full picture. This was the case here and Ellie found it quite difficult to work out the pattern. She thought, perhaps, she could see the ears of a dog, but she could not be certain. Nonetheless, she knew it would be fantastic and, with the vision of this display coming to life fresh in her mind, she hopped through the slats and had a quick nosy around. “Nothing at fault here,” she muttered to herself, and happily bounced out again.

This was the same for boxes two, three and four. It took her hours to scamper from one end of the long street and back again, especially having to avoid the feet of so many festive shoppers, but she did so with a spring in her step. It was only when she checked the fifth and final box that she got a shock of a non-electrical kind! For, just as she was about to pop through the slats, a strange odour entered her nostrils. Mice have a keen sense of smell and Ellie was certain that there was another creature within this box. Quietly, for she didn't want to put herself in any danger, Ellie poked her head inside... and what a sight she beheld! Strewn across the floor was so much plastic casing that Ellie did not believe any wires could have been left untouched! It was clear something had come in here and nibbled through the lot. In fact, Ellie had little hope that the creature in question would still be alive, for she knew just how dangerous it was to meddle with electric cables. It came as a surprise, therefore, when a fearsome face bolted towards the slats where Ellie's little head poked through: it was a rat! The beast was five times the size of Ellie and it had some of the most prominent, yellow teeth Ellie had ever seen. Mice and rats have been known to get along from time to time, but by the terrible look on this rat's face, Ellie was not about to risk finding out if the rodent was friend or foe. She scarpered, and raced back towards her home to tell everyone what had happened.
When Ellie relayed her news to her fellow mice on the Underground, all were in shock. The day before the lights were due to turn on and a whole set of wires looked to be destroyed. Not only that, but there was a ferocious rat living in the box, so they would not be able to fix the problem even if they tried! However, these mice had been looking forward to the display and decided not to give up quite so easily. They put their noses together and formed a plan. As quick as possible, two teams were formed: Ellie and three other mice with some knowledge of electricity and wiring would stick together, while two mice known for their physical strength and strength of character would go ahead... carrying a large hunk of cheese. This cheese was to be used as bait, and if you need any further proof that the Christmas lights are the greatest source of joy for a mouse living under Oxford Street, look no further: for mice to sacrifice their hallowed cheese (saved in case of small pickings at wintertime), the occasion must be very special indeed.
The teams decided that it would look odd to the shoppers of Oxford Street if they saw five mice and a giant hunk of cheese parading down the street, not to mention the fact that the two mice up front didn't fancy themselves or their precious cargo being trampled on. Therefore, they left their tube station under cover of darkness. It seemed strange to think that, this time the following night, the street would not be dimly lit by flickering shop-fronts and the occasional street-lamp, but by a brilliant overhead array, bringing cheer to any person or mouse passing underneath. The mice only hoped they could fix the wiring in time, otherwise the display was unlikely to be so grand after all. With this thought spurring them on, they arrived at the fifth box in no time at all. The strong mice had proved their strength of character by not even nibbling upon the tasty morsel they heaved upon their backs, although the thought had never been far from their minds. It was time to put their plan into action. It was simple, as they had little time to prepare, but they hoped it would prove effective.
Loudly, the team of two mice began discussing the meal before them: “Look what we have here!” Squeaked Monty in feigned delight.
“I do believe that 's the largest morsel of cheese we've found all month,” replied Marvin.
“We should probably take it back to the mouse-hole and add it to our winter stockpile.”
“You're right, of course, but surely a little nibble, just the smallest of tastes wouldn't be missed.” “Good point, Monty, what if the cheese is rancid or – worse – poisoned! We wouldn't want our friends eating that, would we?”
Despite raising their voices loudly, both mice kept an ear open for any movement from within the electrical box. Sure enough, they heard loud rustlings and even thought they heard small squeaks, though these sounds seemed too weak to belong to such a giant rat as Ellie described. They couldn't possibly know what to expect, and this scared them. Meanwhile, Ellie and her team, consisting of Edgar, Hattie and Hubert, were waiting for their cue to jump through the slats.
They didn't have to wait long. Suddenly, the mice heard a loud scraping, then the ground beneath their feet trembled. Bursting through the soil, the rat faced Monty and Marvin and bared its

yellow teeth! Despite being told of the creature's immense size, they were not fully prepared for the manner in which it appeared before them. Of course, thought Ellie, it's much too large to fit through the slats: the rat must have burrowed its way out of the box! This gave Ellie another thought, which she hoped might buy the mice a little more time to repair the cables. However, Ellie could not ponder too long because the appearance of the rat was her cue. She jumped through the slats with her companions by her side. She only hoped that Monty and Marvin were strong and fast enough to stay out of trouble.
As soon as they were inside, the mice got to work. Ellie squeaked her latest idea to the team and they all agreed it was excellent: as the rat had managed to burrow underground, the bottom of the box could not be made of metal. As such, Hattie and Hubert were to nibble a piece of flooring out to cover the entrance hole so ratty couldn't get back in so quickly. Meanwhile, Ellie and Edgar were to begin fixing the electrical nightmare within the box. They had been very careful to bring cling film with them from a dropped sandwich they had found on the platform earlier that week: this was thin enough to fit over their small paws and could be used as rubber gloves to protect them from shocks. Ellie hoped that Hattie and Hubert would be done soon, as she needed more than one extra pair of paws to even hope to finish the work on time.
Meanwhile, poor Monty and Marvin were stuck to the spot. Every hair on their coats stood on end, willing them to run away from the monstrous rat, who by this time was edging closer to them and their cheese. However, they knew that it was their job to keep it distracted for as long as possible. They could tell from its oversized teeth and large belly that the rat would beat them in a fight, but that they would be able to out-run it, should the scene get nasty. They decided to try and reason with the beast: “Why hello there,” squeaked Marvin, barely able to contain the shaking in his voice, “isn't it a charming evening! I hear the C...Christmas lights will be turned on tomorrow. What a treat that will be for all of us, eh?” But the rat ignored him completely and continued advancing. Now it was Monty's turn to try and keep the attack at bay: “Ah, it's the cheese you're after, is it? Well I see no harm in sharing, do you Marvin? What do you say we share it with this d...delightful creature?” Edging ever closer, now baring its fangs, the rat showed no sign of wanting to share. In one leap it flew over both mice and landed directly in front of the guarded cheese. Quick as an electric shock, it grabbed the tasty morsel (which looked much smaller in the jaws of this giant rat) and scurried back into its hole. Little did the rat know what would be waiting on the other side.
Marvin and Monty squeaked to their companions that the rat was returning to the box. By this time, the four electricians had made a decent start at re-casing some loose wires in cling film and re-connecting any places where the rat had actually chewed through the copper. Ellie thought the rat must be very lucky to have not shocked itself and realised that the wooden flooring must have been a significant help. Nonetheless, the team still had lots of work to complete before the mess was fixed, so they were aggrieved to hear that the rat was on its way back. Hubert (the largest mouse amongst them) was chosen to sit on the wooden door they had made to the rat-hole, in order to slow down the rat's imminent entrance, whilst Hattie, Edgar and Ellie continued working hard, their dream of the light display hurrying them on no more than their fear of getting caught by the rat.
Soon enough, Hubert felt a battering-rat heaving its weight onto the wooden circle beneath him. Ratty had the disadvantage of being underneath, but its immense size meant that it was much too strong and Hubert had to call for reinforcements. Monty and Marvin leapt through the slats and joined their friend on the little wooden door, but it was as if the rat was possessed, it was so determined to return! The mice had predicted that it would wish to eat its cheese in peace and might leave them to finish the repair but the rat showed no sign of giving in. With one huge push, the beast tore through the wood, sending the three mice flying to the back of the box. There was no doubt about it: this was one angry rat. The mice had agreed that if the situation looked too dangerous, they should leave and hope a human would finish fixing the lights the following day. At this point, there could be little doubt in their minds that this was a perilous situation.
Hubert crashed into Ellie after the rat sent him flying, forcing her backwards into what was – fortunately – a soft corner of the box. She felt out her new surroundings: pieces of torn up paper,

feathers, sawdust. This must be the rat's nest! Although it was sheltered from the wind, the box was still cold with winter's chill, and Ellie found herself thinking how fortunate she was to have a home on the London Underground. However, she did not have time to dwell on such thoughts, as now it was clear that the rat was heading straight for her. Ellie tried to stand but she had got caught in some cotton from the nest, and her paws – covered as they were in cling-film – were useless. This was the first time Ellie felt genuine fear: was she trapped? Could the rat be so angry at her for breaking into its nest that it might even finish her off? What a thought! She squeaked for her companions to help, but the rat approached steadily with a mean look in its eyes. “Help, help!” Ellie cried and, as she did so, she felt something move beneath her. Then, she heard a tiny squeak.... and another one, then many, many more. Before she had time to realise what was happening, the rat was upon her! Ellie closed her eyes, thinking that she was done for and wishing she had had the opportunity to see the Christmas lights just one more time before her sorry end.
However, rather than feeling the rat's yellow teeth on her skin, she felt the creature merely push her aside. Ellie opened her eyes to see it climb into its nest. Only then, did the mice hear the rat speak for the first time: “Where are you, my darlings,” the rat began, and the mice were surprised to hear a soft, female voice from the rat they had thought so monstrous. “One, two, three, four and... oh where's Raffy, where's Raffy, oh yes there you are my little darling, there you all are.” The mice, who had this point regrouped, were suddenly less sure of their escape plan. It seemed the rat of which they had been so afeard, was just a worried parent trying to protect her nest! She was checking on her young ones, no doubt terrified that the mice had been a threat to their safety. The mice felt ashamed for breaking in without so much as a kind word to this poor creature, forced to find shelter from the winds in a dangerous box full of wires, only for five mice to break in and lock her out.
It was Edgar who broke the awkward silence and bravely approached the nest. “Excuse me, ma'am,” he squeaked, feeling a strange emotion of embarrassment tinged with the remainder of some fear, “I'm sure I speak for us all when I say we are ever so sorry for breaking into your nest. We had no idea you had a family in here.” The rat looked Edgar straight in the eye. “Who do you think you are, luring a hungry mother out with cheese and then blockading me from my babies?” It was clear the rat was still angry and upset. The mice hung their heads in shame. They had not thought to explain to the rat their desire to fix the wires in time for the Christmas light display. They had merely demonised her, wrongly predicting that she would act violently against them. In fact, it was they who had treated her unfairly.
By this point, Monty and Marvin had taken the opportunity to scurry back down the hole and return to the box with the hunk of cheese. The rat had left it behind when she thought her babies might be in danger. They placed it before the rat, offering it as a small apology. Then, Ellie began to explain. She told the rat all about the Christmas lights and how it was her job to check on the electrical boxes. She mentioned how she had seen the mess in this particular box and felt the need to fix it before the following evening. Being very careful not to upset the rat more than she already had, Ellie also explained how the electricity box was not a safe place for a nest, and that by chewing through the wires, the rat had put her life in danger. At this, the rat looked particularly sad: “To think, I chose such an unsafe nest for my little ones!” she mourned, “but really, there was nowhere else, it being so cold outside.” The mice nodded in understanding. At least they were now all on speaking terms.
Ellie introduced all of the mice and asked the rat for her name. It had been too long that the mother had simply been thought of as an angry, nameless rat. “My name is Veronica,” she responded, “and I'm very sorry to have ruined your Christmas light display.” Veronica then went on to explain how the wires were in such a sorry state. She told the mice that a rat's teeth never stop growing, and that hers grew at a particularly fast rate. Therefore, Veronica could not help herself from chewing through the wires as that was the only way to file her oversized gnashers! Ellie now understood why Veronica had such ferocious fangs and suggested gnawing on wood in the future, rather than dangerous wires. Veronica agreed that was probably for the best.
By this point, Hattie had spoken very little. She was a mouse of few words but the time she

saved by not talking was often spent thinking very carefully. This was one of the reasons Ellie had picked her to join her team, and now the mouse spoke up: “I think I've found a solution to suit all of us.” The mice's ears pricked up, as they knew that whatever Hattie was about to say would be of great importance. “We have treated Veronica unfairly and we should find a way to make amends. However, we also want the Christmas light display to go ahead as planned.” No one could fault Hattie's logic so far, and the rodents all nodded for her to continue. Taking a deep breath (for Hattie had already said much more than she usually does in a day), she finished her point: “I suggest we all work together to finish the repairs on this box, and then invite Veronica and her litter to stay with us on the Underground.” Veronica was visibly moved by this idea, as her eyes welled up. The mice nodded their heads once more. Clearly, everyone thought it was a wonderful idea. Veronica's only hesitation was that her babies would not be able to make the journey over, but, as the pups were still so small, the mice agreed to help carry them across, swaddled in material from the nest.
All the mice and Veronica now worked diligently to fix the box in time for the light show. Veronica had never seen the display before and wished her babies' eyes would open in time to see the lights go on. Sure enough, with Ellie leading the team, the cables were fixed in time for the following morning. Now all the mice had to do was transport Veronica's babies back to the underground before the shoppers arrived on Oxford Street. This they did without much fuss. Due to Veronica's large fangs, she was able to hang one baby wrapped in nesting on each of her two bottom tusks. She then hoisted her smallest pup onto her back, leaving Monty and Marvin to carry one baby each. They were even more careful with their load than when they carried their beloved cheese the previous evening! All rodents arrived back at the Underground in the nick of time, as commuters began their morning hustle and bustle to work moments after the team descended onto the tracks.
The mice at Oxford Street were startled to see such a large rat return with Ellie and her team, but Edgar explained everything and Veronica was welcomed with open paws. The mice were congratulated on their work but everyone agreed that they should be more careful on future adventures, so as not to hurt the feelings of other animals. As the day drew on, everyone became increasingly excited. The lights would be going on in no time at all! All of the rodents brave enough to venture to the surface did so carefully, in ones or twos, so as not to draw attention to themselves. Veronica also made it to the surface and insisted on bringing her babies, even though she was large and risked being seen: “I put myself in more danger by living in that box,” she reasoned, “and I'm not missing the display if it's half as good as you mice say it is!”
One minute before seven and the countdown began. The mice's excitement was tinged with worry: what if the repairs hadn't worked and the display didn't go on? At least they would know that they had done their best. Three, two, one, they counted and then held their breath. Nothing. Not a single bulb lit up. But just before they began to panic, whoosh! A heaven opened up above their tiny heads. With a collective gasp, everyone beheld the most magnificent light display they had ever seen. As Ellie had predicted, there were lights in the shape of a dog. It was a moving image, making the puppy look as if it were jumping out of a wrapped Christmas present. Next up, the rodents saw a cat playing with mistletoe. Despite hating cats, they couldn't deny that this was a beautiful image, and at least it wasn't playing with a mouse! On and on they looked, and the display showed more animals, lit up beautifully, each one decked out in festive attire. There were reindeers and penguins and horses with ribbons in their manes.
The mice and Veronica were dazzled, but one section of the display still seemed to be in darkness: it was above the box the mice thought they had fixed! The animals looked at one another in understanding. They realised they had tried their best, and even though this part of the display hadn't worked, the rest of it was so wonderful it barely mattered. More importantly, Veronica and her babies were safely away from electrical shocks and the winter's frost. Veronica looked down at her babies. During the display, most of them had finally managed to open their eyes. Only the smallest one's remained shut. Veronica licked the eyelids of her littlest pup. “Come on, Raffy, open up and see the world.” As if he understood, the tiny creature blinked once, twice and opened his eyes. How wonderful, Ellie thought as she overlooked this touching moment. I only hope the world remains this beautiful for him.

And then, in front of them all - the mice, Veronica, her newborn pups - something began to flicker in the distance. Just like Raffy's eyes, which had struggled open later than his siblings', the final section of the light display blinked twice and then burst into light. All the animals gasped. There, before them, was a mouse, lit up by the box they had fixed earlier that day. It is very easy for a mouse to think of themselves as small and unimportant, considering how humans ignore them or even kick them out of the way on their commutes to work, but here was proof that they were just as magical as any other creature. The lit up mouse jumped one way and the other, with no further decoration than its own festive spirit. Ellie looked at the display mouse and back again at the baby rat. There wasn't much difference between them after all. Perhaps little Raffy's first sight was of a fellow rat pup leaping in the stars.
