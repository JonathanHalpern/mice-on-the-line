Meet Bertie. Bertie is normal-sized for a mouse. He wears an unsurprising grey suit and carries the same style of brown briefcase as many mice of his age and profession also own. Such a bag is designed perfectly to fit a sizeable cheese sandwich (not one crumbs-width but two!) and a copy of The Cheddar Times. In fact, if you were to look inside Bertie's briefcase right now, that is precisely what you would find. That is because, every day of the working week, Bertie reads the same paper and eats the same sandwich.

Now, you may be forgiven for thinking that Bertie is a rather average seeming mouse.
