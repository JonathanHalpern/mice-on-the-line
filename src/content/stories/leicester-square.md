Gerald was a star. Or, at least, that's what Gerald told himself, his friends and his family. It's what Gerald would tell you too if you listened carefully and managed to understand a few basic words in Squeak. Gerald loved nothing more than regaling anyone who would listen with his story: how he was spotted on the underground at Leicester Square by a film director, who whisked him away to train as an actor; how he performed on the set of a multi-million pound blockbuster; and how he had been invited to attend a red-carpeted event at Leicester Square, which would feature some of the world's top actors (amongst them, of course, Gerald himself). The film was called Trapped and Gerald wasted no time in telling every mouse he knew that he was the film's hero. Trapped would be premiered that very evening and the event was to be documented in newspapers and magazines across the world. If I am not world-famous already, Gerald thought to himself and told everyone who cared to hear, I certainly shall be by tomorrow morning.
Despite her son's excitement, Gerald's mum could not help but feel worried for him. The day that Gerald had been taken by the film director had been the scariest in her life. No one had offered any explanation; a man had simply stooped down and carried off her son in a tiny cage. Even Gerald had been terrified, for at that point no one knew that the man was an accomplished director. Everyone assumed the worst: that Gerald had been mouse-napped by a villain and was never to be seen again! So, although Dora was jubilant when her son returned after a month on set, she never quite found it in her heart to approve of his unpredictable and worrisome profession as an acting mouse in the human world. Besides, it was true that Gerald had returned safely, but to Dora's mind her son had turned into a different mouse. He had left young, happy and thoughtful, and returned loud and arrogant. She loved her son just the same, but liked it better when he wasn't such a show- off.
It was while Dora was considering whether or not to attend the film premiere that Gerald burst into her nest. “Mother!” he exclaimed, “I do hope you're planning to wear clothes to my premiere. I have asked the tailoring mice to fashion me a tuxedo from the scraps at Saville Row. You should wear an elegant ball-gown so as to blend in with all the fashionable stars.” Dora, who was already scared about the prospect of attending an event with so many humans, drew the line at a ball-gown: “A mouse in a ball-gown? Blending in? Don't be ridiculous, Gerald. I have four legs and will spend the whole evening tripping over. Besides, what if I need to run from the feet of humans wishing to stamp on me? No, if I am to attend, it shall be as I am. Mice already wear a fine coat of fur and do not need clothes.” Clearly, Gerald had spent far too long in the company of humans, for he was appalled that his mother planned to attend his grand premiere without wearing so much as two pairs of shoes. “If you shan't dress up for the occasion then I shan't invite you,” he told his mother, brattishly, and turned on his back paws to leave her nest. Although Dora was relieved not to have to attend the premiere, she was sad that her son had spoken to her so disrespectfully.
Before Gerald had left Leicester Square to perform in Trapped, he had been toying with the idea of asking his mousehood sweetheart out on a date. Now that he was a star (and because his mother would no longer be accompanying him that evening), he decided he should waste no further time. Gerald puffed out his chest and cleared his throat before arriving at Preethi's nest, which was located under the train-tracks. This was not a particularly desirable location for a young mouse to have her nest as the trains overhead were deafeningly loud, and Gerald worried whether a mouse living in such low society would understand how to act at his grand premiere. He was weighing up whether or not to ask a more distinguished mouse instead, when he saw Preethi's head poke out of her nest. Immediately, he was reminded what a pretty face she had – such sparkling eyes and perfectly quivering whiskers – and he put his doubts to rest.
“Preethi!” Gerald gawked, unable to contain his happiness at seeing her, “I can't believe how long it's been. You look ... lovely.” Preethi, who had not seen Gerald since his return, was equally pleased to greet her old friend. Other mice had told her that he had changed, become a snob, and that he would not likely visit her at her humble home, yet here he was. She decided to ignore their petty remarks. “Gerald!” she squeaked, enthusiastically. “I've missed you.” Gerald blushed. Unlike humans, whose blushing faces may betray a hint of colour, a mouse's blush can go easily unnoticed

behind a face of fur, but Preethi had known Gerald all his life and could tell right away that he was thrilled to be in her company. A vainer mouse may have used this information to flutter her eyelashes and act flirtatiously, but truth be told, Preethi was just as excited in her old friend's company as he appeared in hers. They embraced. Both mice felt very happy. So happy, in fact, that Gerald almost forgot his reason for visiting.
It was during their hug that he noticed a speck of dirt behind Preethi's ear. No matter how clean a mouse keeps herself, it is impossible for one to keep a pristine coat when living under train- tracks. This is what brought Gerald's thoughts back to the evening ahead. Shrugging off his affection, he stepped back and cleared his throat. He addressed his sweetheart formally, as if the pair barely knew each other: “Preethi. I came here to ask you to attend my film premiere this evening. It is a very proper event and I'm afraid you shall have to clean up a bit. We will be leaving the underground at 7pm.” Clearly, he did not read Preethi's expression half as well as she had read his, for he did not see that she looked hurt, and finished his thoughtless invitation by saying, “I would come and collect you, of course, but I shouldn't want to get my new tuxedo dirty by coming back here.” Preethi could no longer hide her emotions. She squeaked at him, tears welling in her eyes, “I suppose that's why it's taken you so long to visit me. My home and I are far too low for you these days. I'm surprised you're here at all.”
“Well, are you coming or not?” replied Gerald, curtly.
“I most certainly will not attend your silly premiere. I wouldn't want to embarrass you in front of all your new friends. Go and find a human to ask instead.” With that, Preethi turned away from Gerald and began cleaning herself. A mouse usually brings its paws from mouth to ear to wash, but this time Preethi only needed to bring her paws up from her eyes, as her tears proved enough for a thorough clean.
Now, we can assume that Preethi was joking when she suggested that Gerald take a human instead of her to the premiere. Clearly, she was implying that Gerald had forgotten his roots as an underground mouse. However, whether it was because he had truly had become a deluded braggard, or because he hid his shame at upsetting his sweetheart behind a cool exterior, Gerald decided that Preethi was right and he should waste no further time in asking a mouse to attend his premiere. By now, he was certain many humans would recognise him and most - if not all - of those would jump at the chance of attending a magnificent event with a star. Plus, there could be no question of a human arriving dirty or without clothes. Yes, he would get changed into his new outfit and wait until a beautiful lady in a ballgown took notice of him. Then, just as he led the heroes to their escape in Trapped, he would make sure his date followed him to the red carpet. Gerald thought his plan was flawless, though we might compare his bizarre situation to that of the princess and the frog. From being so long in the spotlight, he had forgotten the crucial differences between fantasy and reality. Of course, fairy-tales rarely do come true, and it is as improbable that a lady would appear on the London Underground in a ballgown and get whisked away by a mouse, as it is unlikely that a princess might stoop to smooch a slimy frog.
With his new plan lodged firmly in his mind, Gerald hopped on the first Westbound Piccadilly Line train and took it one stop to Piccadilly Circus. This cut his journey time to Savile Row in half, though it was still a fair walk to the tailors for such a small creature and Gerald hoped he would not return late for his big event. Riding the escalator up to the surface, Gerald looked around, expecting fellow passengers to notice him, but they were as oblivious as ever, keeping eyes locked on their mobile phones for the moment when they would regain signal. Nonetheless, the mouse did not lose hope, as he knew he would be unmistakable when he was dressed in his fine new outfit.
Once Gerald arrived at Piccadilly Circus, he was reminded of how big and busy London is. This was particularly different to life on set, when he was attended on in his own little room, with runners bringing him cheese and biscuits and saucers of filtered water. Instead, the only food Gerald could see were dropped crumbs, squashed underfoot or pecked at by pigeons, and the only water came from dirty puddles and a light smattering of rain (which the mouse hoped would stop by the time he reached the tailors.) Moreover, people were everywhere! Gerald had quite forgotten how

inconsiderate humans could be of what lay beneath them, and he spent much of his journey dodging this way and that to avoid being trampled on. By the time he reached Savile Row, Gerald was wet and dirty, and the only thing which stopped him from being in a foul mood was the thought of his new tuxedo and the grand evening he had in store. He zipped through a mouse-hole into the tailor's nest and asked to squeak with the manager.
A small, grey mouse appeared from behind a pile of clothing scraps. He was quite old for a mouse, and spoke in a clipped voice, taking care to enunciate every syllable. “Hello Sir,” he addressed Gerald, “how may I help you?” Gerald told the old tailor that he had sent word for a tuxedo to be made, and that he expected to collect it today. The tailor, however, did not seem to follow: “I'm afraid there must have been a mistake,” he squeaked, “I have had no orders for dinner jackets. In fact, I've never known a mouse to want one. We specialise in sewing scraps of fabric together for cold paws in winter. At the most, we have fashioned overcoats for mice who have lost their fur. But dinner jackets? Excuse me, sir, but that's human clothing, not fit for a mouse.” Gerald was astounded. Hadn't his best friend Caleb promised he would make an order for him, and hadn't Gerald offered him an autograph in payment? Come to think of it, Caleb was smirking throughout their exchange. Gerald had thought his friend was smiling with gratitude but it was clear to him now that the mouse had been laughing at him. Gerald thought of Caleb, of his mother and of Preethi. How all of them were acting so horribly since he had returned from set. He was more determined than ever to take a human with him to the premiere, and although he might not wear a tux for the occasion, he would certainly not arrive unclothed. “Do you have any spare overcoats?” he asked the tailor, who nodded and motioned for his assistant.
Eager to please, the younger mouse dived head-first into the pile of scraps and came out dragging two jackets, one white and one black. Both had four small holes for a mouse to place his feet, and a smaller gap at the back for a tail, but otherwise they were completely plain. They were fastened at the bottom of the body using Velcro and they were lined with thick fabric, as the coats were meant for keeping a bald mouse warm in the winter months. Gerald grimaced: this was not what he had envisaged. Nonetheless, eager to remain upbeat, he told the tailor he would take both. He planned to wear the white coat underneath the black, and that way he could pretend he was in a shirt and jacket after all. “Very good, sir,” replied the tailor, confused as to why a mouse with a good coat of fur was requesting two winter jackets in September. “And how would sir like to pay? We take cheddar and emmental, but I'm afraid we don't trade in blue. The smell alerts the tailors to our whereabouts, you know.” Gerald had supposed he could pay with only his autograph, but thought back to how Caleb had laughed at him and decided against the idea. He asked for the bill to be sent to his address at Leicester Square Underground Station. Then, he got changed into his new outfit (which fit a little too tightly for Gerald's liking, and oh my wasn't it hot?) and left the mouse- hole.
By the time Gerald had returned to Leicester Square, he was a mess. He was so hot from wearing the overcoats that he had sweated through them both. Besides, they were so thick that they had nearly doubled the mouse's weight, meaning the journey took twice as long. The only indignity Gerald thought worse than arriving at his premiere in such a sorry state was to arrive naked, or so Gerald assured himself. What with all the kerfuffle, Gerald was dangerously close to the beginning of his event, so he wiped any negative thoughts from his mind and determined to find himself a date. Not wishing to see family and friends, he waited by the entrance of the Underground for some elegant beauty he could whisk away to the red carpet.
Unfortunately for Gerald, he could not get a good look at anyone's face because they were too high up. Besides, he found himself thinking despondently, no one will be as beautiful as Preethi. Had Gerald followed this thought through and gone to apologise to his dear Preethi, she may well have forgiven him and stopped him from acting such a fool. However, being a stubborn mouse, he shook the thought from his mind and squinted ever harder to make out which lucky commuter he would select for his date. Finally he could make a face out in the crows. There's one! he squeaked delightedly, and rushed over to meet the pretty girl, who skipped out of the station in a purple ball- gown. However, when Gerald got close enough to puff out his chest and tap the lady on her ankles,

he realised his mistake. The girl was certainly very pretty but the only reason he could make out the features on her face was because she was significantly shorter than the rest of the crowd... and why was she significantly shorter, you ask? Because she was a girl of around 3 and a half years old. This also accounted for her ballgown, as the little lady had insisted on spending the day dressed as her favourite princess. Gerald finally gave in to the fact that it was disappointingly rare for a human to wear a ballgown on the London Underground.
As the child was small enough for Gerald to see her face clearly, it stands to reason that she was also small enough to see Gerald. In fact, this little girl had spent a great deal of the day looking at her feet, for otherwise she was likely to trip over the hem of her dress. “Look mum,” she exclaimed, pointing to Gerald. “Why is the fat mouse dressed up as a penguin?” It was just as well that Gerald could not understand, for the chances are that he would have been upset by the child's observation. On the other hand, if he had been able to speak the child's language, he might have prepared himself better for what was coming next. With a shriek, the girl's mother pulled her precious daughter out of the mouse's path and called out, “somebody kill it!” Gerald had hoped that his outfit would make humans warm to him, but in this case it seemed to have had the opposite effect. Perhaps it was because the mouse looked so unnatural in his ill-fitting suit; perhaps it was because he had come so close to the woman's daughter that she thought him a threat; perhaps it was because the weight of his outfit had caused his nose to drip with sweat and his eyes to bulge as if he had some unthinkable disease; or perhaps it was a combination of all these factors. Whatever the reason, Gerald had never felt so different from human beings as then, when at least three large, human brutes rushed over to try and stamp on him. Terrified, the mouse dashed away as quickly as his cumbersome jackets would allow, and managed to avoid hurting anything but his pride.
It's of no use, Gerald concluded with a sad shrug. No one will come with me to the premiere. I shall have to go alone. Feeling sorry for himself, he tramped over to the cinema, where – just as he had imagined – a glorious red carpet had been unfurled. The mere sight of it put a spring back in Gerald's step, and as he sauntered over he decided to put his bad day behind him and concentrate on enjoying a wonderful evening. Already, a crowd had formed around the carpet, though they were kept back by barriers. This was no problem for a mouse, as Gerald could sneak beneath easily. As he did so, he imagined how delighted his fans would be to see him on the famous, scarlet runway. He imagined the cameras, the coos of delight, the crumbs of cheese they might have brought just to throw at his feet. He could see himself on the front cover of tomorrow's papers, though he hoped the article would focus on his outstanding acting skills rather than his ridiculous outfit.
This way and that Gerald scurried until he made it onto the carpet. At last, this was where he was supposed to be! He looked ahead and noticed that some stars and the show's producer were already posing for shots. Behind, he saw a car door open and yes that was the unmistakably dazzling smile of his director. Gerald had imagined he would feel delight at seeing the man who saved him from the monotonous life of a mouse by offering him an acting career, but – to his surprise – his first flashback was to the man who stooped down and trapped him in a cage in front of his family on the underground. Back then, the man's white, toothy smile had seemed more threatening than inviting. Gerald shuddered. That is all in the past, he told himself, and stepped boldly out to the centre of the carpet. Now, I'm a star.
First he heard the deep inward breaths of his fans, then he heard their screams of delight. Next up, the camera flashes were on him and with each snap he felt more exhilarated. They're all here for me! he exalted, basking in the glory that was so rightfully his. His celebration did not last long, however. For what Gerald had failed to realise was that the gasps were those of shock rather than excitement, the screams were of disgust, and the cameras? Well, they were still cameras. But rather than taking photos for the next edition of popular celebrity magazine 'Shoot for the Stars', these pictures were more likely to end up on a website advertising poisonous pellets for pest control.
The crowd's reaction had brought attention to the mouse, and Gerald could now see a security guard running towards him. The first thing he noticed about this large fellow was his beefy outfit, probably exaggerated by the fact that he wore a bullet-proof vest beneath his shirt. Gerald

thought their outfits looked pleasingly similar. The second thing Gerald noticed was that the man was running towards him at a remarkable pace and showed no signs of stopping. The first doubts crept into Gerald's mind. Was it possible he had been mistaken for some shabby street-mouse? Is this fearsome man running at him not to get his autograph, but to shoe him away, or worse? In truth, the security guard was as bewildered as Gerald. His training had taught him how to take down everyone from criminals to over-excited fans, but a mouse was a different thing entirely. In a moment of rash confusion, he removed his gun from its halter and aimed it at the tiny rodent.
The crowd went wild. Previously, this badly dressed mouse had been little more than a threat to the event's sense of style, but now the creature was being chased at gun-point! People's minds swam: was the mouse carrying a fatal disease? Had his outfit been fit with explosives? No one knew what was happening, least of all Gerald, and as everyone ran off in different directions, he took the opportunity to get lost in the crowd and lose sight of the guard. After all, Gerald had seen guns on set in Trapped and, from watching the actors closely, he knew bad things happened when they were pointed in your direction. He took one sweeping glance behind his shoulder to see the stars of Trapped – humans he had worked with on set just weeks before – be ushered inside from the red carpet. When the doors closed, he knew he had been locked out of their world for good.
Gerald arrived at Leicester Square station in a sorry state. Not only was his hair matted and his outfit soiled, but his ego had been bruised beyond repair. He caught sight of himself in a curbside puddle and realised what a mess he had become. Who did he think he was, dabbling in the human world, expecting to be welcomed with open arms by a set of movie stars and directors? He might have saved the day in a make-believe film, but in reality he had made a fool of himself and pushed away those mice who loved him best. Truly, he felt even more foolish than he looked. He used all the strength he had left to tear off his absurd attire and descend into the underground. His mother would wonder why he was home so early from the premiere and he would have to tell her that he had never been invited after all; that his future career as an acting mouse was dead in the water; that she had been right and he had been wrong. Gerald only hoped not to bump into Caleb, Preethi or any of his mouse friends on the way. He knew he owed everyone an apology for his obnoxious behaviour in recent weeks, but right at that moment he felt too down-trodden to begin building bridges.
You can imagine Gerald's distress when, at the bottom of the escalator, he saw three mice gazing up at him. As he got closer, he made out distinct features: his mother's forepaws as she habitually rubbed them together, Caleb's cheeky grin, Preethi's beautiful little nose and wise eyes. He imagined what they must see when they looked up at him! However, despite his concerns, he actually felt some of the heaviness lift from his chest. It was good to be among friends. As Gerald reached the bottom of the escalator, his mother rushed forward and embraced him. “Gerald dear, are you alright? Look at the state of you! Why aren't you at your premiere?” It was only as his mother pulled him closer that he realised he was rubbing against fabric rather than fur. He had been so happy to see fellow mice that he had not realised they were wearing clothes! The mice were in simple costumes, no doubt stitched together from scraps of abandoned canvas bags, but they were certainly more respectable than his attempt at a smart outfit.
“Mum, you hate clothes!” Gerald squeaked.
“It meant so much to you, I thought I should give it a go. They're nothing special but...”
“They're wonderful.” Gerald turned to face his friends. “You all look wonderful.” The others, however, were still confused as to why Gerald was wearing nothing. Caleb was the only mouse who seemed to have an idea. He stepped forwards. “I shouldn't have lied to you about the tuxedo, Gerald. We're friends and I should have realised the premiere meant a lot to you. I'm sorry.”
“And I'm sorry I didn't support your career,” said his mother.
Gerald was dumbfounded. Just as he had realised what a foolish creature he had been, here were his loved ones apologising to him. “I don't deserve your apologies,” he retorted. “I have been rotten since returning to the underground. Who can blame you for avoiding my premiere or having a laugh at my expense?” It was now Preethi's turn to speak up: “You're right. You don't deserve their apologies.” Gerald blushed. He remembered how he had spoken to her earlier that day. “You've

been unthoughtful and unkind, arrogant and stupid.”
“I know I have,” Gerald bowed his head. “And I'm so sorry.”
“We will have to see about that,” teased Preethi.
“But why are you here now, after I acted in such an awful way?”
“When you left my nest, I was embarrassed and upset. You said some very hurtful things. However, when I stopped to think about it, I realised I felt sorry for you. You were thrown into a different world and then we expected you to return as if nothing had happened. Besides, friends deserve second chances.” By this point, Gerald's eyes were filled with tears, and it was no longer because his clothes fit too tightly. He felt profoundly grateful for his lot and promised never to give his friends cause to doubt him again. “Enough with all that,” Caleb interjected, never one to get too tied down with heart-felt conversations, “don't we have a premiere to get to?”
Gerald explained what had happened. From his trip to the tailor's, to being faced down at gun-point, he spared no detail. While his mother reeled in horror, Caleb shook with laughter. Unlike humans, a mouse's anatomy is not built for laughter. On the rare occasion you might see a mouse laughing, you'd probably just think it had a bad case of hiccups. By the point where Gerald re- enacted his escape from the confounded guard, Caleb was rolling on his side, barely able to take a breath. “I must admit,” said Preethi, “your acting skills are rather good.” Gerald blushed. “Nonsense,” he squeaked, “I left that life in the ditch with my outfit. And I'm never going back.”
Despite his protestations, the four mice ascended the escalators once more and tottered over to the cinema where Trapped was being premiered. The show was almost over by the time they had sneaked through the drains and into cracks and under doors to arrive in the theatre, but they were just in time to see Gerald save the day by leading a group of humans to the exit of a cave. Everyone was mightily impressed to see the mouse ten times his size, lit up on screen, and they even managed to guzzle on some dropped popcorn that lay at the feet of other starring members of the cast. Of course, they left before the film credits. Mice rarely read languages other than Squeak and, besides, they did not want to risk another calamity by leaving at the same time as the humans. Gerald doubted he would be mentioned anyhow, as no one he worked with knew his real name.
The four mice returned home happy, though they all swore never to wear clothes again (itchy, horrible things). Despite all odds, Gerald had enjoyed his premiere more than he could ever have hoped. Nonetheless, he was happy to put those days behind him and continue life as an underground mouse. Therefore, it is not without some irony that Gerald – who had so wanted to be a star – was indeed featured on the front page of the London newspapers the following day. The story of how a mouse (in what appeared to be a tacky tuxedo) gatecrashed the premiere of Trapped took the world by storm. Experts identified him as the very mouse who starred in the film and the papers even gave him a stage name: The Big Cheese. They urged anyone who saw a mouse in a dinner jacket to phone in, so that the same mouse might star in Trapped 2. It's probably for the best that Gerald was none the wiser to any of this nonsense, as well we know he is a mouse susceptible to arrogance and hot-headedness. Instead, he lived his best life away from stardom, on the underground with his friends, family and beloved Preethi. What mouse could want for more?
