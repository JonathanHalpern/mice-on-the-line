Gerald was a star. Or, at least, that's what Gerald told himself, his friends and his family. It's what Gerald would tell you too if you listened carefully and managed to understand a few basic words in Squeak.



Gerald loved nothing more than regaling anyone who would listen with his story: how he was spotted on the underground at Leicester Square by a film director who whisked him away to train as an actor, how he performed on the set of a multi-million pound blockbuster, and how he had been invited to attend a red-carpeted event at Leicester Square, which would feature some of the world's top actors (including, of course, Gerald himself).
