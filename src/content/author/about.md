Hello! My name's Natalie and I was born and grew up in London. From a young age, my mum would take me on the London Underground and point out all the little mice that scurried underneath the tracks. I was amazed at how they lived their lives among all the hustle and bustle, and wondered how they must feel when huge trains thundered over their heads!

As I got older it became clear that I loved to write. Silly stories, sad stories, stories for grown ups and for young children, I enjoyed them all. Then, one day, my mum gave me the idea: "Why don't you write stories about the little mice you loved as a child?" She told me that each Underground station should have its own mouse, and that each mouse's story would be about that station. It was a wonderful idea and I promised her I would give it a go.

Here is a recent picture of my mum and me:

After a difficult year at work, my husband and I decided to go travelling. We left London and had the most magical time. Whether it was because I finally had some free time to write, or because I was far from home and missed seeing those little mice on the Underground, it was on these travels that I remembered the promise I had made to my mum all those years ago. I told my husband about my plan to write the Mice on the Line series. He thought it was a fantastic idea and offered to make me a website to showcase the stories.

Here is a picture of Jonny and me on our wedding day in Thailand, on February 2019:

I wish I remember what he said in this moment!

Now I have written six stories about Mice on the London Underground and hope to write many more. One of them is complete with beautiful watercolour images; you can read it now by going to the Home Page and clicking on the mouse at Charing Cross!

I would love to launch my stories soon - perhaps in time for the opening of the Elizabeth Line - but in the meantime I am happy to have them here for all to read... especially for any children who love the Underground mice as much as I did! So, thanks mum and thanks Jonny for your ideas and input, and if anyone reading this wants to get in touch, please use the contact page. I look forward to hearing from you!
